Bill Document Generator
A Python GUI application that converts SMS bill notifications into organized Word documents. Created for my grandfather who rents out 8 rooms and receives separate electricity/water bills via text messages. The program:

📱 Takes screenshot inputs of bill messages
📄 Generates standardized Word docs (2 bills per page)
🖼️ Maintains consistent formatting and layout
🏠 Handles up to 8 separate room bills

Perfect for landlords managing multiple utility bills received digitally. Includes an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users.
